# Survey Opossum Plus Mailer

## Description

You have completed Survey Opossum, so it is now a playground on which we can practice other new skills.  In this assignment, you will write a mailer for an existing Survey Opossum app.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand Rails mailers.
* Be able to send mail from a development machine.
* Be able to send mail from an app on Heroku.

## Deliverables

* **A Repository.** You will all be forking the code from one weekend submission.  Your instructor will provide that link.  Fork it to your individual account and make changes there.

## Normal Mode

For this assignment, you will be modifying Survey Opossum to send an e-mail after a survey is created.  After writing a survey, a page is currently displayed with a link to take the survey. Add a field and a button on this page.  If the user types in an e-mail address (or e-mail addresses separated by commas) then hits the button, an e-mail is sent to those e-mail addresses with the link to take the survey.

## Hard Mode

Add Devise to your application.  Remove all of your own authentication code and replace it with Devise.  The documentation will be your friend:

* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
